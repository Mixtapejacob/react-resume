I've always like a challenge that is presented to me and that's exactly what this career change has been. Coming from a background of sales to web development was a 360 moment being able to be creative in what I'm coding and see it come to life. As I continue to grow in my skills as a software developer I'm Fasnicated about learning and growing my skils which is the best part because the value I can bring to a company with the added tools I already have is second to none. In my free time i enjoy writing different langauges such as HTML,CSS, javascript, react ,etc..",
